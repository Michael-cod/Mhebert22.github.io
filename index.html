<h1>Mchaels Magic<h1> 

<h3>When I was six I got my first magic set. Every day I learned a new trick.
Finally I made a whole show, but I wasnt finished yet. I performed my 
show to my family. They said it was good but not good enough, so I got back to work and 
I bought  more tricks and practiced for months and months. Finally I created a amazing show 
so I then performed it to my parents and they were left baffled! <h3>

im available for birthdays,weddings,partys,and more.
